# UnityPackageImporter

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that facilitates the import of Unity Packages.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [UnityPackageImporter.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/NeosUnityPackagesImporter/releases/download/v1.0.0/unityPackageExtractor.rar) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

This might freeze your game for a little bit during import. Recommended to import one file type at a time, pairs nicely with [NeosModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings)

Also! Best performs with one package at a time (as they can be beefy), and should be able to mix and match packages with other files but I make no guarantees. Have fun!
