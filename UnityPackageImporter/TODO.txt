Things that need to be done:
files imported like FBX's through the scene importer need to have their IK set up like the prefabs <- this needs to be generalized. Scene Prefabs and Prefabs need to go through the same humanoid stuff.
Prefab "m_Modifications" in scene files need to be yaml parsed and applied to their imported FBX <- almost done
Prefab and scene object import scalings need to be predictable and not shit
Materials need to import their images and settings properly
IUnityObjects in the scene need to recognize which prefab instances they belong to
Prefabs need to not assume they are humanoid, and need to have data validation for such.
Things that could be done:
adding VRC menus/toggles
